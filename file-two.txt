Comprehensive Git Repository Access Guide: SSH vs HTTPS
 (Short, Concise PDF Version)
 Overview
 A simplified overview comparing SSH and HTTPS methods for cloning and accessing Git repositories,
 including setup, security, workflows, and troubleshooting.
 Understanding Authentication Methods
 HTTPS- Uses username + password or personal access tokens.- Easy setup, works behind firewalls.- Requires repeated authentication; less secure with passwords.
 SSH- Uses public/private key pairs.- More secure, no repeated authentication.- Requires initial setup and key management.
 HTTPS Method
 Basic Setup
 1. Install Git
 2. Configure global settings (name, email, default branch)
 3. Enable credential caching or credential manager
 Authentication- GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket use Personal Access Tokens- Generate token → Use as password when prompted
 SSH Method
 SSH Key Setup
 1. Check existing keys (~/.ssh)
 2. Generate new key (Ed25519 recommended)
 3. Start SSH agent and add key
 4. Copy public key → Add to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
 5. Test SSH connection
 Cloning Repositories
 Using HTTPS
 git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
 Using SSH
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
 Daily Operations- Check remotes: git remote -v- Change remote URL: git remote set-url origin- Pull: git pull- Push: git push- Push with upstream: git push -u origin branch
 Troubleshooting
 HTTPS Issues- Authentication errors → regenerate token- SSL certificate issues → update CA certificates- Clear cached credentials if needed
 SSH Issues- Permission denied → key not added- SSH agent not running → restart agent- Wrong key for repo → configure ~/.ssh/config
 Best Practices
 Security- Use Ed25519 keys- Protect keys with passphrases- Rotate keys/tokens regularly- Never share private keys
 Productivity- Use SSH config for multiple accounts- Enable useful Git configs (autosetupremote, rebase, prune)
 Quick Reference
 Clone:
 HTTPS: git clone https://...
 SSH: git clone git@...
 Check remote:
 git remote -v
 Change remote:
 git remote set-url origin
Test connection:
 HTTPS: git ls-remote origin
 SSH: ssh -T git@github.com
